## Technical Assessment for Test Engineer â€“ Renz Escalera

- This is the technical assessment submission for the Test Engineer position by Renz Escalera. The test automation framework is built using Cypress, a modern JavaScript-based test automation tool.

## Why Cypress?

- I selected Cypress for this assessment due to its developer-friendly approach, seamless support for both UI and API testing, and robust debugging capabilities. My decision is based on both my experience with Cypress and its technical advantages.

## Key Benefits of Cypress

- API & UI Testing: Cypress allows efficient testing of both backend APIs (cy.request()) and frontend UI interactions in a single framework.
- Fast Execution & Real-Time Debugging: Runs directly in the browser, making tests faster and easier to debug.
- Automatic Waits & Reduced Flakiness: No need for explicit waits or sleep commands, ensuring more reliable tests.
- Built-in Screenshots & Video Recording: Helps in debugging test failures without additional configuration.
- Extensive Experience: I have hands-on and professional experience using Cypress for both API and UI automation, enabling me to follow best practices and efficient implementation.

## How to setup the environment variables

- Inside of the .env file in the root folder contains the necessary environment variables such as base url, username, and password.
- username and passowrd are not currently setup for security purposes. Follow the example below to correctly set it up:
  `USER_NAME=fakeEmail@test.com`
  `PASSWORD=Password123`

## Setting Up and Running Cypress Tests

1. Clone the repository using the command: `git clone https://github.com/renzescalera/renz-assessment-test-engineer.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder - Example: `cd C:\users\your-computer\renz-assessment-test-engineer`
3. Install dependencies using the command: `npm install`
   - After installation, use the command: `npm -v` this confirms successful installation
4. Now Cypress can run using the command below:
   - To run Cypress UI: `npx cypress open`
   - To run Cypress in headless mode: `npx cypress run`
